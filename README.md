# TYPO3 extension `jumpurl`

This extension adds functionality to configure and handle short links in the
frontend. It also provides a secure, hash-based way to access files for
download.

The feature was part of TYPO3 until TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS and was then moved to its
own extension, which got its own public repository.
