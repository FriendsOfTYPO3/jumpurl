Initially developed by Kasper Skaarhoj, it was polished by over 100 contributors
in this area while being part of the TYPO3 Core, and then extracted into its own
extension by Alexander Stehlik and Benni Mack.

This package is now maintained by a loose group of TYPO3 enthusiasts inside
the TYPO3 Community. Feel free to contact `Benni Mack`_ for any questions
regarding `jumpurl`.
